## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

Learnt how event listeners work!
```js
bar1.addEventListener("mouseover", showDetail1);
```

### Continued development

Seeing as i started learning javascript over a month ago, there's probably a more compact and shorter approach to my js code, but its a start and at least it works!
